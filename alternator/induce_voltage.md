#   INDUCED VOLTAGE PRODUCED BY A CHANGING MAGNETIC FIELD IN A CONDUCTOR

If a magnetic field is moved near a conductor, the field will bend around the conductor as shown in the diagram below. Notice the fields around the conductor in the centre (cross-section view) with the magnet (two poles shown) being drawn down past it. 
For the conductor in Figure 28
Â 
* There is a resulting force against the conductor
* A circular magnetic field built up around the conductor
* A potential to do work is developed

As the magnetic field moves past the wire, energy from the moving magnetic field is transferred to the wire and a potential is built up in it as it moves. The wire then has the ability to produce power.

The magnitude of the driving EMF force can be easily demonstrated. In the above diagram (Figure 29) a concentrated source of magnetic flux (magnet) is moved into and out of, a coil of wire and the result is observed on a voltmeter.

Remembering the right-hand rule, we observe that the meter will move upscale and down scale while the magnet is in motion in and out of the coil. The voltage produced is both polarity sensitive and direction sensitive. Also, the voltage increases in magnitude as the rate of movement increases.

## Transformer Action
By combining the previous two principles, we now have the basic operation of a transformer:

When alternating current (I<sub>1</sub>) is forced by a potential (V<sub>1</sub>) through a conductor, a magnetic field consisting of lines of flux (M) is set up around the conductor.

When the magnetic field (M) moves relative to a conductor, a potential (V<sub>2</sub>) is produced across that conductor. This will supply a current (I<sub>2</sub>) to connected load.

In the example below, since both coils share the same flux (M) then the input and output EMF.s are proportional to the number of turns of conductor around that flux:

E<sub>2</sub>/E<sub>1</sub>=N<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>1</sub>


Or the output voltage = V<sub>2</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> * N<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>1</sub>

Although the concept is simple, it is the basis of every transformer. From the largest power transformer to the smallest found in logic controllers, the only difference is the construction due to voltage level, KVA rating and alternating frequency.
