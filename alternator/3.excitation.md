# Field Excitation and Exciters

* DC field excitation is an important part of the overall design of a synchronous generator 
* The field excitation must ensure not only a stable AC terminal voltage, but must also respond to sudden load changes 
* Rapid field excitation response is important


  ## Three methods of excitation
1. __slip rings__ link the rotor’s field winding to an external dc source 
2. __dc generator exciter__ 
  - a dc generator is built on the same shaft as the ac generator’s rotor 
  - a commutator rectifies the current that is sent to the field winding 
3. __brushless exciter__ 
  - an ac generator with fixed field winding and a rotor with a three phase circuit 
  - diode/SCR rectification supplies dc current to the field windings
